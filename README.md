# ðŸ§  Graph Machine Learning Activists (GMLA) âœ¨

## Meetings
Fridays, 4:00 pm to 5:45 pm  
Ellingson Conference Room 316, Missoula Public Library

## About Us
We study and collaborate on graph machine learning projects, referencing [Stanford's CS224W course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=RDCMUCBa5G_ESCn8Yd4vw5U-gIcg&start_radio=1&rv=JAB_plj2rbA&t=3). Our focus is on indie experiments using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert books into video games, and engineering activism through games.
We are actively engineering a humane future, one edge at a time.

## What We Discuss
- Open-ended exploration of GNN-related arXiv papers
- AI alignment, AGI, transhumanism
- Open source software/hardware
